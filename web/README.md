# Coil web

Next.js app for Coil. Connect a wallet on Mezo testnet, preview a loop from the live oracle and the MUSD/BTC pool, then create an account, loop, unwind, and set the guard.

Setup, contract addresses, and risks are in the repository README.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server listens on [http://127.0.0.1:43123](http://127.0.0.1:43123).

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_COIL_FACTORY` in `.env.local` after `CoilFactory` is deployed. Until then the page quotes a loop and leaves the transaction buttons disabled.
